## Features

- **Night Mode**: minimize jarring flashes of white regions on dark backgrounds. This is a combination between:
    - *lower whitepoint*: lower the whitepoint of the screen to make white regions appear less bright
    - *warm colors*: filters blue light to further minimise eye strain on bright colors
    - *enhanced contrast*: keeps text readable even at such low brightness levels

The following video shows the difference between simply having Dark Mode on with a low brightness, and having Night Mode on top of that.

If you pay attention to the hand that is scrolling, you'll notice that the flashes of light from the white regions have less effect with Night Mode enabled. In the same way, your eyes will see less of a difference in perceived brightness between the dark background and the bright regions that may appear unexpectedly while scrolling on a web page.

*The technique is quite similar to what f.lux does, but with the added benefit of enhancing contrast for readability.*

**How to activate Night Mode:**

- using the CLI: `lunar night-mode toggle`
- using the *Night Mode* Shortcuts action
- from the Right Click menubar icon menu

## Fixes

- Important fix on DDC commands causing a crash when the queue is full
- Allow `http` on non-local custom domains/IPs of light sensors
- Fix not keeping Disconnect API disabled with DisplayLink running
- Fix built-in screen having 100% brightness after waking up from sleep in some cases
- Make sure external sensor `available` state is kept up to date
    - Fixes a problem where both internal and external sensor data would be used at the same time

## Improvements

- Limit Gamma `whites` and `blacks` sliders to avoid full black/white screens
- Allow disabling **Sub-zero dimming** by setting Min Brightness to 0
