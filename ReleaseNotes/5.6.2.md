## Licensing model

**Some clarifications are needed after the change:** 

* I don't have any plans on releasing a major version this year
* If for some reason I have to do that, everyone who paid for the 1-year of free updates before the change will receive the update for free if it's within their update period

This was not a sudden change to rip users off as some like to accuse. I liked the old model, and money-wise I would have probably had a more sustainable income with the 1-year model. If Apple breaks DDC yet again, the multi-month-long effort I'll have to put in to fix that won't warrant a major release as it would feel more like a bug fix for end users, while it would feel more like writing a whole new app for me.

But for months people kept asking for this major version model, mostly because it feels less like a subscription. This is just a compromise so I can move on and focus on building Lunar instead of constantly answering questions about how Lunar Pro is or isn't a subscription.

## Features

#### XDR Contrast Enhancer slider

Improve readability in direct sunlight when using `XDR Brightness`.

The contrast slider allows adjusting the pixel value formula for the brightest/darkest areas, to get even more contrast out of the miniLED display.
