## Fixes

* Fix stack overflow crash in detecting if a display is built-in
* Check for display ID to be online before reading Gamma
* Make ColorSync profile matching in Software Control mode M1 only
    * This is because Apple's `CGGetDisplayTransferByTable` is buggy on Intel and crashes the app on some systems
