## Features

* Clock Mode: schedule brightness and contrast presets based on sunset/sunrise/noon or a specific time
* Dark Overlay for displays that don't support Gamma or DDC (DisplayLink and Sidecar usually)
    * Contrast does nothing when the overlay is used
* Display filters for deciding what to show in the Preferences window:
    * Virtual displays
    * AirPlay displays
    * Projectors
    * Disconnected monitors

## Fixes

* Fix crash when the DDC faults storage was accessed from multiple threads
* Fix crash that happened on modifying the I2C controller cache when the IO registry tree changed

## Improvements

* Improve Gamma smooth transitions by removing unnecessary animations and allowing it to appear on Mission Control
    * Thanks to [@waydabber](https://github.com/waydabber) for finding out this edge case and for suggesting that the window needs to be set as `stationary` to fix it
* Recover Facelight state after screen sleep/wake
* Improve smooth and slow transitions for Apple vendored displays that can use Native Controls
* Reset audio device cache on wake and on display reconnection to avoid volume controls not working in some cases
