## v6 beta 1

### Fixes

* Fix EDID reading on Apple Silicon
* Fix **Notch** button appearing on wrong displays
* Fix **Network Control** not being detected for more than one display in specific cases
* Fix muting displays wrongly when using the volume up/down custom hotkeys
* Avoid showing both the Auto XDR tip and the XDR brightness key tip at the same time

### Improvements

* Remove Sidecar and Airplay displays from onboarding and diagnostics since they only support Overlay dimming which never fails
* Don't show *App Info* and *BlackOut Info* on first launch to avoid mental burden on new users
* Hide sliders and XDR buttons for displays that are in BlackOut
* Lock contrast by default for new monitors
* Allow Lunar to be uninstalled from Launchpad 
    * Open Launchpad, hold Option key, click on the `x` button of the Lunar icon
    * Using the technique from [Making macOS apps uninstallable](https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/Making%20macOS%20apps%20uninstallable)
