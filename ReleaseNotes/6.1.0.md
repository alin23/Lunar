### Algorithm Variations

#### Fully Automated

This makes Clock Mode override any manual adjustments done by the user.

It also makes it re-apply the brightness of the previous schedule after standby/wake or after a screen reconnection.

#### User Controlled

This makes Clock Mode respect manual adjustments done by the user.

Brightness will always transition to the next schedule starting from the user adjusted brightness.

Also if the system wakes within 30 minutes of a passed schedule, the brightness of that previous schedule is re-applied

### Features

* Add **Send volume to all monitors** setting
    * Helpful for setups with multiple similar monitors, where the audio device can't be matched to the correct monitor
