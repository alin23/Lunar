## Features

* BlackOut OSD with 3 seconds delay
    * Allow the system to settle screen configuration
    * Allows the user to press `esc` to cancel Auto BlackOut

## Improvements

* Save last resolution before mirroring and re-apply it after mirroring ends
    * This works around a system bug where a non-native resolution is applied when mirroring is disabled

## Fixes

* Lower CPU usage by fixing a recursive call on the resolutions dropdown
