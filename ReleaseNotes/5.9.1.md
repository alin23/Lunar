## Hotfix

* Fix non-responsive DDC for some specific monitor models

## Features

### Adaptive Sub-zero Dimming

Full support for using Sub-zero dimming automatically inside adaptive modes like Sync/Sensor/Location.

The **Auto-learning** algorithm can now learn Sub-zero brightness values and apply them in the future based on the current ambient light or sun position.


### Native OSD
for Sub-zero dimming, XDR Brightness and Contrast adjustments

* Improves writing speed with an algorithm that adapts to each monitor's I²C max speed
* Improves DDC Read reliability

## Improvements

* Allow changing the ambient light sensor hostname from the command line
    * `defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar sensorHostname mysensor.local`
* Make BlackOut without mirroring a bit faster
* Better detection for MCDP29XX chips
* Better detection for projectors and virtual displays
* Deactivate license on oldest device automatically when activation fails

## Fixes

* Fix custom hotkeys not allowing *hold to change continuously*
* Fix possible crash when `MPDisplayMgr` can't lock access to displays
